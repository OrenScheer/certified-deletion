Quantum encryption with certified deletion

This repository implements an encryption scheme with the property of certified deletion, as proposed by Broadbent and Islam in their paper [Quantum Encryption with Certified Deletion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03551).

The main notebook is [run.ipynb](run.ipynb), which can either generate a new message and key to encrypt and test, or use an existing state to do a new test.
